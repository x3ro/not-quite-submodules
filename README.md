# capistrano-bootstrap

This gem can be used to keep capistrano configuration synchronized between multiple projects. If you have several git repositories in which you are using the same or very similar capistrano configurations, this gem is for you.



## How to set up?

You'll need a new git repository containing your configuration. Lets say you currently use the following directory structure in your projects:

    project/
        Cap
        config/
            capistrano/
                deploy.rb
                util/
                    important.rb
                    stuff.rb
                project.rb
                stages/
                    production.rb
                    staging.rb
        [...]

Let us also assume that everything in the `util/` folder as well as `deploy.rb` is never modified, that is, the project specific configuration resides solely in `stages/` and `project.rb`. You'd now create a new git repository containing the following:

    deploy.rb
    util/
        important.rb
        stuff.rb

Then you'd simply remove these files from your project structure, resulting in:

    project/
        Cap
        config/
            capistrano/
                project.rb
                stages/
                    production.rb
                    staging.rb
        [...]

Now you want to add the following lines to the beginning of your `Cap` file:

    require 'capistrano-bootstrap'
    CapistranoBootstrap.invoke(
        "git@github.com:you-on-github/capistrano-configuration.git",
        :config_dir => "config/capistrano",
        :target_path => "config/.config_repo"
    )

The `invoke` method has the following optional parameters:

* `:config_dir` => Where you would like to have your global capistrano config copied to.
* `:target_path` => The directory to which the configuration repository will be cloned.

The parameter values in the above `invoke` example are the default values.

By default, capistrano-bootstrap will try to update the configuration repository once every 24 hours. You may overwrite that behavior (i.e. force an update) by invoking your capistrano task like this:

    CAPBOOTSTRAP_FORCE=1 cap deploy

For your convenience, capistrano-bootstrap also generates a `.gitignore` file in the `config_dir` which ignores all content copied from the configuration repository.



## How it works

capistrano-bootstrap simply clones the specified repository, checks out the latest tag (by version number!) and copies the content to the specified `config_dir`.

There _must_ be at least one tag in the configuration repository, otherwise the update will fail. The version comparison/ordering is done using the [Versionomy](https://github.com/dazuma/versionomy) gem, for example:

    v1.0 < v1.0.1 < v1.1 < v1.1.1 < ...



## Caveats

* capistrano-bootstrap does not currently **delete** any files, it only overwrites updated files or creates newly created ones.



## TODO

* Write spec
* Support file deletion
